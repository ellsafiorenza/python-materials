1. Basic Introduction to Python
===============================

How to code in Python?
----------------------

**Will be moved to another file**

In this module, we will learn coding in :guilabel:`Jupyter Notebook` environment. 
You can use free online resources such as `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`_ 
or `DeepNote <https://deepnote.com>`_ to build python notebook. 
However, if you prefer to use you local computer, you can access :guilabel:`Jupyter Notebook` 
using `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.

1.1 Mathematical Equation (Non-Library)
---------------------------------------

Python can act as you own calculator by analyzing basic mathematical equations such as 
addition, substraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

1.1.1 Addition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> 1 + 1
2
>>> 100 + 50 + 25 + 20 + 5
200
>>> (-101) + 2
-99

.. note::

    We can add `negative` number with `positive` number. This will be similar to subtraction. 

1.1.2 Substraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> 1 - 1
0
>>> 100 - 50 - 10 
40
>>> 2 - 100
-99

.. note::

    Subtracting a larger number to a smaller number will produce negative result.

1.1.3 Multiplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiplication in Python uses `asteric (*)`. 

>>> 1 * 0
0
>>> 100 - 50 - 10 
40
>>> 2 - 100
-99

1.1.4 Division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> 1 / 1
1
>>> 100 / 3
33.3333
>>> 2/5
0.4
    
1.1.5 Modulo
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modulo is the reminder of a division. The equation is `n = c * d + r`, which means for a number `n`, 
    
>>> 1 % 1
0
>>> 99 % 10
9
>>> 2 % 5
2

1.1.6 Exponential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>> 10**2
100
>>> 100**(1/2)
10

1.2 Variable Names
------------------

>>> year = 2022
>>> year
2022
>>> my_name = "Jane Doe"
>>> print(my_name)
"Jane Doe"
>>> my_name
Jane Doe

From the example above, we can give a name to our value. To assign a value to variable name, we must use `=` (equal sign) in between the variable name and value that we want to store.

.. note::

    Be careful while naming your variable as it could affecting the built in function that python already provide us. For example, `max = 5` will change the purpose of built in `max` function and assign `5` as its value. 


1.3 Basic Data Type
-------------------

There are X data type in Python, that is, String, Integer, Float, Boolean, xxx.

1.3.1 String
~~~~~~~~~~~~

replace

1.3.2 Integer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

replace

1.3.3 Float
~~~~~~~~~~~

replace

1.3.4 Boolean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**replace**
